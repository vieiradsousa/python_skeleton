HOW TO USE SKELETON (From: Learn Python the Hard Way by Zed Shaw)

1. Make a copy of skeleton directory. Name it after your new project.

2. Rename (move) the `NAME module to be the name of your project or whatever you want to call you root module.

3. Edit your `setup.py` to have all the information for your project.

4. Rename `tests/NAME_tests.py` to also have your module name.

5. Double check it's all working by using `nosetests` again.

6. Start coding.
